Technical-Writing-Portfolio
Iâ€™m a Technical Communication student at Seneca Polytechnic, currently in my final semester. This portfolio showcases course projects that demonstrate my skills in user-focused documentation, Adobe FrameMaker, MadCap Flare, and Microsoft Style Guide-compliant writing. Each project reflects industry-standard practices in structure, formatting, and accessibility.
