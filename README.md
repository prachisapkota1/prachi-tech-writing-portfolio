Created for educational purposes as part of my Technical Communication program at Seneca Polytechnic. Developed a beginner-friendly user guide for ScreenToGif using Adobe FrameMaker. Included structured chapters, step-by-step instructions, cross-references, indexing, and accessibility features. Followed the Microsoft Style Guide for clarity and consistency.
